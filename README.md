Wireguard connected Private cloud for Talos k8s clusters on demand

## Goals
Following goals are ordered from highest priority to lowest

1. Knowledge > Efficiency
2. Breadth > Depth
3. Security > Observability > DevEx > OpEx
4. Custom > Generic

### Goal 1
Expand my knowledge in managing on Prem infrastructure at differnt virtualization levels
Force to take hands on experience on IT levels that have always delegated to cloud

Consequence: More consuption of HW resources creating VMs

### Goal 2
Focus on holistic (fu corporate lingo) setup i.e up and running as many different **necessary** components
i.e one enterprise-level tool could do multiple services, but I want to get familiarized with the fundamentals of each part

### Goal 3
Security: Mitigate breaches and security as risks of setup
Observability: Make sure I dont set my HW on fire (at least without warning)
DevEx: Make sure I enjoy working on it and it works
OpEx: Make sure I do it "right"

### Goal 4
Implement my own idea even if it could be better solved another way.
Adapt solution as own stupidity reveals itself
